# Import that!

This repository contains tutorials for writing bad Python code. Among other
things, you will learn some useless skills and bad habits:

- writing David Beazley style metaprogramming code that only you can understand
- violating PEP-8 by writing things like `import tokenize,io` and lines that greatly exceed 79 characters
- writing anti-[Jack Diederich](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9pEzgHorH0) 1-method classes

This repository is inspired by the work of other mad scientists :)
