# Import That!

This repository contains tutorials for writing bad Python code.

Among other things, this tutorial will teach you how to write anti-PEP8
code like `print ("Hello" ) ;` and annoy everyone who read your code.
But more importantly, you will learn to write David Beazley style
metaprogramming code that other people don't understand.

This repository is inspired by these things:

- [David Beazley's type checking framework](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_0wjzuMfc)
